### Jobs

- [10/2024-] Postdoctoral research assistant at University of Edinburgh
  -> **add some description**

- [03/2021-] Doctoral Reseacher at University of Siegen
  -> I am currently working as a PhD student in the TP1 research group for particle physics at Universit\"{a}t Siegen, focusing on lattice simulations of QCD. This role involves participating in research projects requiring strong dedication and focus. I work with others both within the TP1 group and internationally to complete research, and also as part of larger collaborations focused on delivering high precision lattice results. Further research interests include new physics models and quantum computation for high energy physics.

- [08/2018-08/2020] Leisure Assistant/Lifeguard at Freemans Quay Leisure Center
  -> The challenge of being a lifeguard is in the potential for life-or-death situations. As a lifeguard, you present a positive leisure experience, which focuses on dealing with any customer issues and maintaining en enjoyable environment for all. This must be balanced with constant vigilance over the pool area in case of the need for intervention or rescue, with the proper knowledge and ability to save any lives that may be at risk. An ongoing training and development program must be maintained to keep these skills up to date.

- [09/2018-07/2019] Bar Steward at St Mary's College Bar, Durham University
  -> Over the academic year 18/19, I was in charge of the college bar with duties such as stock control, staff hiring and training, shift assignment, and maintainence and cleaning. I was selected for my strong work ethic and commitment to the role, and developed skills into this management role to improve the college bar, bringing in more customers and creating a safer and more efficient working environment for staff. When managing staff who were also my peers, it was important to find the proper balance in the workplace so I would be taken seriously in my role as their manager.

- [10/2017-03/2020] Bar Star at St Mary's College Bar, Durham University
  -> I am responsible for serving and interacting with customers. This requires developing keen social skills to balance a friendly atmosphere for customers with a presence of authority to those who may trouble in a high-energy, intoxicated environment. It is important to maintain a high level of cleanliness in a frequently messy environment, and keep a mind for potential welfare issues such as binge drinking which must be monitored and reported.

### Talks + Seminars Given

- [02/2024] MIT Virtual Lattice Field Theory Colloquium Series "Using Gradient Flow to Renormalise Matrix Elements for Meson Mixing and Lifetimes"
  -> Neutral meson mixing and meson lifetimes are theory-side parametrised in terms four-quark operators which can be determined by calculating weak decay matrix elements using lattice QCD. While calculations of meson mixing matrix elements are standard, determinations of lifetimes typically suffer from complications in renormalisation procedures because dimension-6 four-quark operators can mix with operators of lower mass dimension and, moreover, quark-line disconnected diagrams contribute. We present work detailing the idea to use fermionic gradient flow to non-perturbatively renormalise matrix elements describing meson mixing or lifetimes, which later is to be combined with a perturbative calculation to match to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme.

- [03/2023] ECT\* Workshop on The Gradient Flow in QCD and other Strongly Coupled Field Theories "Using Gradient Flow to renormalise Matrix Elements for B Meson Mixing and Lifetimes"
  -> Neutral B meson mixing and B meson lifetimes are theory-side parametrised in terms of $\Delta B=2$ and 0 four-quark operators which can be determined by calculating weak decay matrix elements using lattice QCD. While calculations of $\Delta B=2$ mixing matrix elements are standard, matrix elements with $\Delta B=0$ for extracting lifetimes suffer from complications in standard renormalisation procedures. Here dimension-6 four-quark operators mix with operators of lower mass dimension using standard renormalisation procedures and, moreover, quark-line disconnected diagrams contribute. We present work detailing the idea to use fermionic gradient flow to non-perturbatively renormalise $\Delta B=0,2$ matrix elements, later to be combined with perturbative input in order to develop renormalisation+matching-to-$\overline{\rm MS}$ procedures for these operators. The well-studied $\Delta B=2$ matrix elements governing mixing are first considered to test and validate the method before turning the focus to the quark-line connected $\Delta B=0$ matrix elements.

- [08/2022] The 39th International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2022) "B Meson Decay Constants Using Relativistic Heavy Quarks"
  -> We present the status of ongoing work to extract pseudoscalar and vector decay constants for B(\*), B_s(\*) and B_c(\*) mesons and determine phenomenologically interesting ratios such as fB_s/fB or fB\*/fB. Our calculation is based on Nf = 2+1 dynamical flavour gauge field ensembles generated by the RBC/UKQCD collaborations using domain wall fermions and the Iwasaki gauge action. Using domain wall light, strange and charm quarks, and relativistic b-quarks, we obtain results at multiple lattice spacings and valence quark masses. We then extrapolate to physical quark masses and the continuum and compare to predictions by other lattice collaborations and QCD sum rules. Furthermore, we use our results to test heavy quark symmetry relations.

- [06/2022] Young Scientists Meeting of the CRC TRR 257 "Non-Perturbative Calculations for B-mesons"
  -> We present the current status of work to determine non-perturbative contributions to the physics of B-mesons. Using the methods of lattice QCD, QCD sum rules, and the gradient flow, we consider quantities such as decay constants, dimension-6 and -7 matrix elements for lifetimes, and dimension-7 matrix elements for mixing.

- [03/2022] DPG Fr\"uhjarhstagung Heidelberg 2022 "Decay constants of B, B_s, and B_c mesons"
  -> We present the status of our ongoing work extracting B-meson decay constants fB with B = B0,B+,Bs,Bc. Our calculation is based on Nf = 2+1 dynamical flavour gauge field ensembles generated by the RBC/UKQCD collaborations using domain wall fermions and the Iwasaki gauge action. Using domain wall light, strange, and charm quarks and relativistic b-quarks we obtain results at three different lattice spacings a ≈ 0.11,0.08,0.07 fm and multiple valence quark masses. We perform a global fit to obtain phenomenologically relevant results in the continuum and at physical quark masses.

- [03/2022] DPG Fr\"uhjarhstagung Heidelberg 2022 "Flavour and LHC constraints in the 2HDM"
  -> We present comprehensive studies of the Two Higgs Doublet Model with Type I and Type II Yukawa couplings. To find bounds on the mass spectrum of these models, contributions to flavour, Higgs, and electroweak observables from the new scalars and couplings are considered, using theoretical constraints to inform these fits. We compare the results of these fits to those from direct searches at the LHC, finding regions of parameter space allowed by both flavour and collider. In addition, we test the consequences of our results on electroweak baryogenesis and the possibility of generating a strong first order phase transition in the 2HDM.

- [05/2021] Annual Meeting of the CRC TRR 257 "Cornering the Two-Higgs-Doublet II Model"
  -> We perform a comprehensive study of the allowed parameter space of the Two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) of type II. Using the theoretical framework flavio, we combine the most recent flavour, collider and electro-weak precision observables with theoretical constraints to obtain bounds on the mass spectrum of the theory. In particular we find that the wrong-sign limit is excluded and potential deviations from the alignment limit can only be small. Finally we test the consequences of our allowed parameter space on electro-weak baryo genesis via the programme package BSMPT.

### Further Experiences

- Sys Admin
  -> During my time at UniSiegen, I have taken on responsibilities as part of the Sys Admin team managing and maintaining the computer systems of the TP1 group. This involves educating users on working with Linux systems and providing assistance and new services as needed by the group.

- Teaching Assistance
  -> Throughout my Masters and PhD, I have taken up teaching assistant duties for various courses. These include 'Scientific Programming' and 'Practical Lab: Intro to Lattice QCD', as well as advising a Bachelors student in their thesis. I have lent my knowledge of particle physics and programming in languages such as C++ and Python to good use in order to educate students and advance their own academic careers.
